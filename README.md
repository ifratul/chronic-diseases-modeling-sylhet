# Spatial Autoregressive Modeling of Chronic Diseases in Sylhet

This project investigates the prevalence, spatial distribution, and risk factors of chronic diseases among elderly individuals in Sylhet, Bangladesh, using spatial autoregressive modeling with negative binomial regression in R.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
1. Estimate the prevalence of chronic diseases in the elderly population of Sylhet.
2. Evaluate spatial autocorrelation using Moranâ€™s I.
3. Identify demographic, lifestyle, and environmental risk factors using a spatial model.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Methods
- Language: R (v4.4.2)
- Packages: `spmodel`, `spdep`, `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`
- Model: Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) with Negative Binomial regression
- Moran's I for spatial autocorrelation
- Backward stepwise variable selection

According to our study, 98.7% of the respondents have confirmed having at least one chronic disease in Sylhet district. The number of chronic diseases present in a respondent varied from 0 to 17. The most prevalent disease categories are musculoskeletal disorders, digestive diseases, eye diseases, hypertension, skin diseases, diabetes and kidney diseases, cardio-vascular disorders.

Our research showed, Females had a 24% higher risk of multiple chronic diseases compared to males (IRR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.34). Protective factors included caregiving by family (IRR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.87), occasional red meat consumption (IRR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.00), and white rice/flour intake (IRR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.96). Risk factors included passive smoking (IRR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.39), regular fast-food consumption (IRR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.38), tooth loss (IRR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.28), and major surgery history (IRR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.33).

To address the high prevalence of chronic diseases among the elderly in Sylhet, Bangladesh, public health interventions should prioritize reducing passive smoking exposure through community education and enforcing smoke-free policies in public spaces.  
Promoting balanced dietary habits is essential, encouraging moderate red meat consumption while discouraging regular fast-food intake, and further research should clarify the unexpected protective role of white rice/flour consumption and high salt intake. Strengthening oral health programs with regular dental check-ups is critical to prevent tooth loss and mitigate associated systemic health risks. Additionally, enhancing family caregiving support through training and awareness can improve health outcomes. Region-specific healthcare policies, informed by spatial data, should be developed to optimize resource allocation.  
Finally, further studies are needed to explore the counterintuitive link between weekly exercise and chronic disease prevalence, addressing potential reverse causality. Integrating these measures into Bangladeshâ€™s healthcare framework will help alleviate the chronic disease burden among its aging population.
